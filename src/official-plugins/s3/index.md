# Kuzzle Plugin S3

S3 has a right system to limit who can upload files to buckets.

[Presigned URLs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/PresignedUrlUploadObject.html) are special disposable Urls generated by S3. It is possible to upload a file directly to one of these URLs so that it can be stored into the bucket.

These URLs must be generated on the server side, this plugin includes among other things the generation of these URLs so that developers can then send their files directly to S3 from a client application.
