# Introduction

Kuzzle can be customized and extended using plugins.

This page explains how to install and configure a plugin. The other pages cover the four plugin interfaces exposed by Kuzzle:

- [Hooks](/core/1/plugins/hooks/)
- [Pipes](/core/1/plugins/pipes/)
- [Controllers](/core/1/plugins/controllers/)
- [Authentication Strategies](/core/1/plugins/strategies/overview/)

A single plugin can implement as many of those interfaces as necessary.
