# Getting Started with Kuzzle

In this tutorial you will learn how to install and run **Kuzzle**.

## Running Kuzzle

This section explains how to quickly get Kuzzle up and running using our installation script.

Open a terminal and run the following command:

```bash
bash -c "$(curl https://get.kuzzle.io/)"
```

This command downloads and executes the installation script. The script checks the system for a set of prerequisites and installs any necessary tools, like Docker or Docker Compose. When the installation is complete it will automatically run Kuzzle.

</div>

This command downloads, installs and runs Kuzzle.

Use the `--no-run` option to prevent the script from running Kuzzle.

Once the installation process is complete, you will see the following message:

```bash
#Â Kuzzle is now running
```

Your Kuzzle is now running! To test it, you can explore the main HTTP API by clicking this <a href="http://localhost:7512?pretty">link</a> or by using cURL on the command line:

```bash
curl "http://localhost:7512/?pretty"
```

If everything is working you should see a JSON document that contains a list of API endpoints.

Congratulations! You have completed the Kuzzle installation, it will now accept requests on <code>localhost:7512</code>:
<ul>

</ul>
