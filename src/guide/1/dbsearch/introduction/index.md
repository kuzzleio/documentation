## Code Example: Database Search 

Kuzzle uses Elasticsearch as its datastore and provides a user friendly interface so that you can quickly create documents and take advantage of Elasticsearch's fast search capabilities.


## Configure Kuzzle

First let's make sure Kuzzle is running and create the index and collection we will use to store documents. Follow these [instructions]({{ site_base_path }}guide/1/getting-started/#running-kuzzle").


## Create Your App

Now that we have our Kuzzle configured, we can start programming our App. Here is an outline of what the App will do:

1. *Connect to Kuzzle*
2. *Create a document* that will be stored in Kuzzle
3. *Search for the Document*
