# Getting Started

Kuzzle emits numerous events, especially for API requests.

Plugins can [listen]({{ site_base_path }}plugins/1/essentials/) to events.

And if a plugin adds new API [controllers]({{ site_base_path }}plugins/1/controllers), then Kuzzle automatically triggers [dedicated events]({{ site_base_path }}plugins/1/events/plugin-events).
