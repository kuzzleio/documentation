# Pipes

Pipes are functions plugged to [events]({{ site_base_path }}plugins/1/events/), called synchronously by Kuzzle, and receiving information regarding that event.

Pipes can:

* Decide to abort a task. If a pipe throws an error, Kuzzle interrupts the task, and forwards a standardized version of the thrown error to the originating user
* Change the received information. Kuzzle will use the updated information upon resuming the task

<div class="alert alert-warning">If a pipe takes too long to respond, Kuzzle will eventually abort the entire task with a <a href="{{ site_base_path }}plugins/1/errors/gatewaytimeouterror">GatewayTimeout</a> error. The timeout value can be changed in the <a href="{{ site_base_path }}guide/1/essentials/configuration">configuration files.</a></div>

## Usage

Plugins can register pipes by exposing a `pipes` object: keys are listened [events]({{ site_base_path }}plugins/1/events/), and values are either a function name to execute whenever that event is triggered, or an array of function names.

```javascript
this.pipes = {
  '<kuzzle event to listen>': '<plugin function name to call>',
  '<another event>': ['list', 'of', 'plugin', 'functions', 'to call']
};
```

If multiple pipes are plugged to the same event (either from the same plugin or from multiple ones), they are executed sequentially, in no particular order, each pipe receiving updated information from their predecessors.

Pipes must notify Kuzzle about their completion by one of these two means:

* by calling the `callback(error, updatedData)` function received as their last argument (leave the `error` null if the pipe executed successfully)
* by returning a promise, resolved (or rejected) upon the completion of the pipe

If a pipe throws an error, it is advised to throw one of the available [KuzzleError]({{ site_base_path }}plugins/1/errors/kuzzleerror) object. Otherwise, Kuzzle will reject the task with a `PluginImplementationError` error.

## Example

```javascript
module.exports = class PipePlugin {
  constructor () {}

  /*
    Required plugin initialization function
    (see the "Plugin prerequisites" section)
   */
  init (customConfig, context) {
    /*
      Attaches the plugin function "addCreatedAt" to the Kuzzle event
      "document:beforeCreate"
     */
    this.pipes = {
      'document:beforeCreate': 'addCreatedAt'
    };
  }

  // Called whenever "document:beforeCreate" is triggered
  addCreatedAt (request, callback) {
    request.input.body.createdAt = Date.now();
    callback(null, request);
  }
}
```
