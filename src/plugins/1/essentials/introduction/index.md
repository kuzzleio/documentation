# Introduction

Kuzzle can be customized and extended using plugins.

This page explains how to install and configure a plugin. The other pages cover the four plugin interfaces exposed by Kuzzle:

- [Hooks]({{ site_base_path }}plugins/1/essentials/hooks/)
- [Pipes]({{ site_base_path }}plugins/1/essentials/pipes/)
- [Controllers]({{ site_base_path }}plugins/1/essentials/controllers/)
- [Authentication Strategies]({{ site_base_path }}plugins/1/strategies/overview/)

A single plugin can implement as many of those interfaces as necessary.
