## Introduction

Kuzzle can be customized and extended using plugins.

This chapter explains how to install and configure a plugin. The other chapters in this section cover the four plugin interfaces exposed by Kuzzle:

- [Hooks](../hooks)
- [Pipes](../pipes)
- [Controllers](../controllers)
- [Authentication Strategies](../strategies)

A single plugin can implement as many of those interfaces as necessary.
