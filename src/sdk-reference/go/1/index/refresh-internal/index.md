# RefreshInternal

When writing or deleting security and internal documents (users, roles, profiles, configuration, etc.) in Kuzzle, the update needs to be indexed before being reflected in the search index.

The `refreshInternal` action forces a [refresh]({{ ../site_base_path }}/sdk-reference/index/refresh), on the internal index, making the documents available to search immediately.

<div class="alert alert-info">
  A refresh operation comes with some performance costs.
  
  From [Elasticsearch documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/docs-refresh.html):
  "While a refresh is much lighter than a commit, it still has a performance cost. A manual refresh can be useful when writing tests, but donâ€™t do a manual refresh every time you index a document in production; it will hurt your performance. Instead, your application needs to be aware of the near real-time nature of Elasticsearch and make allowances for it."
