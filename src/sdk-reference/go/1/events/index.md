# Events

An event system allows to be notified when the SDK status changes. These events are issued by the [Kuzzle SDK object]({{site_base_path }}sdk-reference/go/1/kuzzle).

Subscription to these events is possible by passing a channel that will receive data when a specific event is issued by the SDK instance.  

These channels can be added and deleted respectively by the methods [addListener]({{site_base_path }}sdk-reference/go/1/kuzzle/add-listener) and [removeListener]({{site_base_path }}sdk-reference/go/1/kuzzle/remove-listener).

**Note:** channels receive data in the order of their insertion.
