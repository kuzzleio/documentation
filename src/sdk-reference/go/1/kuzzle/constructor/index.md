# Constructor

This is the main entry point to communicate with Kuzzle.  
Each instance represent a connection to Kuzzle with specific options.

## Signature

```go
NewKuzzle(protocol connection.Connection) (*Kuzzle, error)
```

## Arguments

| Argument   | Type                  | Description                           | Required |
| ---------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------- | -------- |
| `protocol` | connection.Connection | The protocol used by the SDK instance | yes      |

### **protocol**

A [Protocol]({{ site_base_path }}/sdk-reference/protocols/create-new-protocol) is a structure implementing the `connection.Connection` interface.
The available protocols are:

- `websocket.Websocket`

The protocol must be instantiated and passed to the constructor.
It takes the following arguments:

| Argument  | Type          | Description                     | Required |
| --------- | ------------- | ------------------------------- | -------- |
| `host`    | string        | Kuzzle hostname to connect to   | yes      |
| `options` | types.Options | Kuzzle connection configuration | yes      |

The `options` parameter of the protocol constructor has the following properties.  
You can use standard getter/setter to use these properties.

| Option              | Type         | Description                                                        | Default        | Required |

| `autoReplay`        | bool      | Automatically replay queued requests on a `reconnected` event      | `false`        | no       |
| `autoResubscribe`   | bool      | Automatically renew all subscriptions on a `reconnected` event     | `true`         | no       |
| `offlineMode`       | int          | Offline mode configuration. `types.Manual` or `types.Auto`      | `types.Manual` | no       |

| `queueTTL`          | int          | Time a queued request is kept during offline mode, in milliseconds | `120000`       | no       |
| `queueMaxSize`      | int          | Number of maximum requests kept during offline mode                | `500`          | no       |

| `volatile`          | VolatileData | Common volatile data, will be sent to all future requests          | -              | no       |

## Getter & Setter

These properties of the Kuzzle struct can be writable.  
For example, you can read the `volatile` property via `getVolatile()` and set it via `setVolatile()`.

**Notes:**

- multiple methods allow passing specific `volatile` data. These `volatile` data will be merged with the global Kuzzle `volatile` object when sending the request, with the request specific `volatile` taking priority over the global ones.
- the `queueFilter` property is a function taking a `QueryObject` as an argument. This object is the request sent to Kuzzle, following the [Kuzzle API]({{ site_base_path }}api/1/query-syntax) format
- if `queueTTL` is set to `0`, requests are kept indefinitely
- The offline buffer acts like a first-in first-out (FIFO) queue, meaning that if the `queueMaxSize` limit is reached, older requests are discarded to make room for new requests
- if `queueMaxSize` is set to `0`, an unlimited number of requests is kept until the buffer is flushed
- the `offlineQueueLoader` must be set with a function, taking no argument, and returning an array of objects containing a `query` member with a Kuzzle query to be replayed, and an optional `cb` member with the corresponding callback to invoke with the query result
- updates to `autoReconnect`, `reconnectionDelay` and `sslConnection` properties will only take effect on next `connect` call

## Return

A `Kuzzle` struct and an [error struct]({{ site_base_path }}sdk-reference/go/1/essentials/error-handling).  
The `error` struct is nil if everything was ok.

## Usage

In a first step, you have to create a new `connection.Connection` and pass it to the constructor.  
By now the only connection available is `websocket.Websocket`.
