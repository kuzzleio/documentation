# login
Login a user using a specified strategy and their credentials.

If the Kuzzle response contains a JWT Token, the Kuzzle SDK token is set and the `loginAttempt` event is fired immediately with the following object:
`{ success: true }`
This is the case, for instance, with the `local` authentication strategy.

If the request succeeds but there is no token, then it means that the chosen strategy is a two-steps authentication method, such as the OAUTH strategy. In that case, the `loginAttempt` event is **not** fired. To complete the login, the `setJwtToken` method must be called either with a token or with an appropriate Kuzzle response.

If the login attempt fails, the `loginAttempt` event is fired with the following response:  
`{ success: false, error: 'error message' }`

This method is non-queuable, meaning that during offline mode, it will be discarded and the callback will be called with an error. <a href="{{ site_base_path }}guide/essentials/user-authentication/#local-strategy">Learn more.</a>

## login(strategy, [credentials], [expiresIn], [callback])

| Arguments | Type | Description |
|---------------|---------|----------------------------------------|
| ``strategy`` | string | Authentication strategy (local, facebook, github, ...) |
| ``credentials`` | JSON object | Optional login credentials, depending on the strategy |
| ``expiresIn`` | *varies* | Login expiration time |
| ``callback`` | function | Optional callback handling the response |

**Note:** If the ``expiresIn`` argument is not set, the default token expiration value will be taken from the Kuzzle server configuration.

By default, Kuzzle comes with the [kuzzle-plugin-auth-passport-local](https://github.com/kuzzleio/kuzzle-plugin-auth-passport-local) plugin, which provides the `local` authentication strategy.
This strategy requires a `username` and `password` as `credentials`

## Callback Response

Returns a JSON object containing the Kuzzle response.
