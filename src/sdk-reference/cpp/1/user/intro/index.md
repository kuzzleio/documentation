# Introduction

The `User` class is the SDK representation of a Kuzzle [user](https://docs-v2.kuzzle.io/guide/1/essentials/user-authentication/#creating-users-default).

Instances of the `User` class are returned by methods such as [auth:getCurrentUser]({{ site_base_path }}sdk-reference/cpp/1/auth/get-current-user).
