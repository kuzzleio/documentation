# scroll
Returns a [SearchResult]({{ site_base_path }}sdk-reference/android/3/search-result/) object containing the next page of the scroll session, and the `scrollId` to be used in the next `scroll` action.  
A scroll session is always initiated by a `search` action and including the `scroll` argument; more information below.

<div class="alert alert-info">
There is a small delay between the time a document is created and its availability in our search layer (usually a couple of seconds). That means that a document that was just created might not be returned by this function at first.
</div>

<div class="alert alert-info">
  To get more information about scroll sessions, please refer to the <a href="{{ site_base_path }}api/1/controller-document/search">API reference documentation</a>.
</div>
