# Error Handling
[snippet=handling-errors-1]
All methods that accept a callback as an argument can return an error. The error can be generated directly by the SDK, or by Kuzzle and included in the response to a request.

All errors generated by Kuzzle contain the following properties:

* `message`: the error message
* `status`: an error code following the [HTTP standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes)
