# Constructor

This is the main entry point to communicate with Kuzzle.
Each instance represent a connection to Kuzzle with specific options.

## Arguments

```javascript

**Notes:**

- multiple methods allow passing specific `volatile` data. These `volatile` data will be merged with the global Kuzzle `volatile` object when sending the request, with the request specific `volatile` taking priority over the global ones.
- the `queueFilter` property is a function taking an object as an argument. This object is the request sent to Kuzzle, following the [Kuzzle API]({{ site_base_path }}api/1/query-syntax) format
- if `queueTTL` is set to `0`, requests are kept indefinitely
- The offline buffer acts like a first-in first-out (FIFO) queue, meaning that if the `queueMaxSize` limit is reached, older requests are discarded to make room for new requests
- if `queueMaxSize` is set to `0`, an unlimited number of requests is kept until the buffer is flushed
- the `offlineQueueLoader` must be set with a function, taking no argument, and returning an array of objects containing a `query` member with a Kuzzle query to be replayed, and an optional `cb` member with the corresponding callback to invoke with the query result
- updates to `autoReconnect`, `reconnectionDelay` and `sslConnection` properties will only take effect on next `connect` call

## Return
