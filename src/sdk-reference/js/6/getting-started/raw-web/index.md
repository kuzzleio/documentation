# Getting Started with Kuzzle in the browser

This tutorial explains how to use **Kuzzle** with the **Javascript SDK** in a **browser**.  

To follow this tutorial, you must have a Kuzzle Server up and running (you'll need to know the hostname of the machine running it). If this is not already the case, take a look at [how to run Kuzzle]({{ site_base_path }}guide/1/getting-started/running-kuzzle).

Before proceeding, make sure your system has **Node.js** version 8 or higher (<a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/">instructions here</a>) installed.

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to **store** a document and **subscribe** to notifications in Kuzzle using the Javascript SDK.

## Prepare your environment

Create your playground directory:

```sh
mkdir "kuzzle-playground"
cd "kuzzle-playground"
```

<div class="alert alert-info">
If you are performing a clean install you might get some <code>UNMET PEER DEPENDENCY</code> warnings, these are safe to ignore as they refer to optional dependencies.
</div>

Then, create an `index.html` file with the following structure:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8" />
  <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
  <title>Kuzzle SDK Playground</title>
  
  <!-- If you are coding for Internet Explorer, please uncomment the following line -->
  <!-- <script src="//cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bluebird@3.5.3/js/browser/bluebird.min.js"></script> -->

  <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/kuzzle-sdk/dist/kuzzle.min.js"></script>
</head>
<body></body>
</html>
```

<div class="alert alert-info">
If you are using Internet Explorer (not Edge), you are responsible of installing a Promise polyfill, which enables IE to support
Javascript <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise">Promises</a>.
Our advice is to use <a href="http://bluebirdjs.com/docs/getting-started.html">Bluebird</a>, as shown in the code example above (refer to the commented lines in the <code>head</code> tag).
</div>

Then, add the code below in the `body` tag.
This loads the SDK and connects it to a Kuzzle instance using the WebSocket protocol. If an error occurs, it is displayed
in the console. Once the connection is established, a success message is displayed in the console.

[snippet=load-sdk]

<div class="alert alert-info">
Replace <code>kuzzle</code> with <code>localhost</code> or the hostname where your Kuzzle server is running.
</div>

Now you have to add the code that will access Kuzzle to create a new index `nyc-open-data` and a new collection `yellow-taxi` 
that you will use to store data later on. Make sure the code inside your `body` tag looks like the following:

[snippet=prepare-db]

Now, let's take a look at what your script is doing:

* creates an instance of the SDK,
* connects it to Kuzzle running on `kuzzle` (change the hostname if needed) using WebSocket,
* creates the `nyc-open-data` index,
* creates the `yellow-taxi` collection (within the `nyc-open-data` index),
* disconnects from Kuzzle after the collection is created,
* displays an error whenever something goes wrong.

Run this code by opening the `index.html` file in your favorite browser.
The console should output the following message:

```plaintext
Successfully connected to Kuzzle
nyc-open-data/yellow-taxi ready!
```

<div class="alert alert-success">
Congratulations! You are now ready to say Hello to the World!
</div>

<div class="alert alert-info">
If you reload the page, you should see an error in the console. This is OK, since Kuzzle is just refusing to create
the <code>nyc-open-data</code> index as it already exists.
</div>

## Create your first "Hello World" document

Create a `create.html` file with the same structure as `index.html` (see above).
And, right like before, add some code to the `body` tag:

[snippet=create]

This code does the following:
* creates an instance of the SDK,
* connects it to Kuzzle running on `kuzzle` (change the hostname if needed) using WebSocket,
* creates a new document in the `yellow-taxi` collection, within the `nyc-open-data` index
* logs a success message to the console if everything went fine
* logs an error message if any of the previous actions fails
* disconnects from Kuzzle after the document is created or if an error occurs

Run this code by opening the `create.html` file in your favorite browser.
The console should output the following message:

```
Successfully connected to Kuzzle
New document successfully created!
```

<div class="alert alert-success">
You have now successfully stored your first document into Kuzzle. Click <a href="{{ site_base_path }}guide/1/essentials/installing-console">here</a> to see how you can use the <strong>Kuzzle Admin Console</strong> to browse your collection and confirm that your document was saved.
</div>

## Subscribe to realtime document notifications (pub/sub)

Kuzzle provides pub/sub features that can be used to trigger real-time notifications based on the state of your data (for a deep-dive on notifications check out the <a href="{{ site_base_path }}sdk-reference/js/6/realtime-notifications/">realtime notifications</a> documentation).

Let's get started. Create a `subscribe.html` file (same structure as above) with the following code in the `body` tag:

[snippet=subscribe]

Run this code by opening the `subscribe.html` file in a new tab, leaving the previous one (showing `create.html`) open.
The console should output the following message:

```
Successfully connected to Kuzzle
Successfully subscribed to document notifications!
```

The code in the `subscribe.html` page is now running endlessly, waiting for notifications about documents matching its filters, specifically documents that have a `license` field equal to `'B'`.

Now go back to the other tab and reload `create.html`.

This creates a new document in Kuzzle which, in turn, triggers a [document notification]({{ site_base_path }}api/1/essentials/notifications/#documents-changes-messages-default) sent to the `subscribe.html` tab. Check the `subscribe.html` tab: a new message is printed everytime a document is created using the `create.html` code.

```
New driver Sirkis with id AWccRe3-DfukVhSzMdUo has B license.
```

<div class="alert alert-success">
Congratulations! You have just set up your first pub/sub communication!
</div>

## Where do we go from here?

Now that you're more familiar with Kuzzle, dive even deeper to learn how to leverage its full capabilities:

* discover what this SDK has to offer by browsing other sections of this documentation
* learn how to use <a href="{{ site_base_path }}koncorde/1">Koncorde</a> to create incredibly fine-grained and blazing-fast subscriptions
* learn how to perform a <a href="{{ site_base_path }}sdk-reference/js/6/auth/login">basic authentication</a>
* follow our guide to learn how to <a href="{{ site_base_path }}guide/1/essentials/security/">manage users, and how to set up fine-grained access control</a>
