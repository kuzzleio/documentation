# BaseController

Base class for a [custom SDK controller]({{ site_base_path }}sdk-reference/js/6/extend-sdk/#define-a-custom-sdk-controller).  

Custom SDK controllers have to extend the `BaseController` class to be added with the [Kuzzle.useController]({{ site_base_path }}sdk-reference/js/6/kuzzle/use-controller) method.
