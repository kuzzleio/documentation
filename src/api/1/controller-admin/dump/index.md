# dump

{{{since "1.4.0"}}}

Asynchronously create a snapshot of Kuzzle's state.  
Depending on the configuration of Kuzzle, it may include the following:

* a coredump of Kuzzle
* the current Kuzzle configuration
* server logs
* Node.js binary & properties
* a list of OS properties
* plugins configuration
* usage statistics of the dumped instance

(See [configuration]({{ site_base_path }}guide/2/essentials/configuration))

The generated directory can be used to feed a complete report to the support team.  
This report is the same as the one generated during a crash.  

**Note:** in a Cluster environment, the dump action will be propagated across all nodes.
