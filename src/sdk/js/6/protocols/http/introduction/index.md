# Http

The Http protocol can be used by an instance of the SDK to communicate with your Kuzzle server.

<div class="alert alert-info">
  <p>
  This protocol does not allow to use the [real-time notifications](/sdk/js/6/essentials/realtime-notifications/).
  </p>
  <p>
  You have to use [WebSocket](/sdk/js/6/protocols/websocket) or [SocketIO](/sdk/js/6/protocols/socketio) protocol instead.
  </p>
</div>
